        "definition": "Otaku (Japanese: \u304a\u305f\u304f, \u30aa\u30bf\u30af, or \u30f2\u30bf\u30af) is a Japanese word that describes people with consuming interests, particularly in anime, manga, video games, or computers. Its contemporary use originated with a 1983 essay by Akio Nakamori in Manga Burikko. Otaku may be used as a pejorative with its negativity stemming from a stereotypical view of otaku as social outcasts and the media&#39;s reporting on Tsutomu Miyazaki, &#34;The Otaku Murderer&#34;, in 1989. According to studies published in 2013, the term has become less negative, and an increasing number of people now identify themselves as otaku,[1] both in Japan and elsewhere. Out of 137,734 teens surveyed in Japan in 2013, 42.2% self-identified as a type of otaku."
